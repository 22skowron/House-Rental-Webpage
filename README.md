provided by Angular where I followed step-by-step to build an Angular website displaying housing rent offers across the USA. The project was implemented using (at this time) the latest version of Angular - v18. All CSS files and assets (including property photos) used in this project were downloaded from the resources provided in the tutorial series.
## Description

The website allows users to view various housing rent offers in the USA. Each offer can be clicked to view more details. There's also a search bar implemented to filter the results by city. Additionally, each housing offer details page contains a form where users can input their name, last name, and email to apply for the offer. These values are currently logged to the console for demonstration purposes.
